# 📄 Intelligent Document Classifier

This is a simple AI-powered document classification tool built in Python. It helps categorize short business-related text into one of several classes: Finance, Tech, or Marketing.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- TfidfVectorizer + Naive Bayes

## 🚀 How It Works
- Uses a small dataset of sample business documents
- Transforms the text using TF-IDF vectorization
- Trains a Naive Bayes classifier
- Runs in a command-line interface where users can enter their own text and get a predicted category

## 🧪 Example
```
Enter a short business text: Let's improve our SEO for the product launch.
Predicted Category: Marketing
```

## 📁 How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python classifier.py
```

3. Type your own business-related text and see how it's classified!
